1. The program is wrote to find the low weight collision of inside hash function that has 4 function(hv1,hv2,hv3,hv4).
2. To reduce the calculated amount. We use branch and bound method.
3. If it need long time, click any key to stop. It can continue compute next time.
4. If it is new compute, just input two parameters that program ask.
The compiler is vs2008, there is a command _kbhit() is in conio.h


the format of output file:
had found collisions,  the minimum fixed cells
